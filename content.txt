1.Class and Objects 
2.Class has data/attribute and func/methods
   ->Code walkthrough
   ->attribute get called itself ,methods called maunually
3.Why Python is called object oriented programming-everything in an python is an obj(Data staructur,data types etc)
4.Advantages of OOPs concept:
    ->You can create your own datatypes
    ->Code Reusability
    ->Debugging
    ->easy to colab
5.End to end project (Chatbook class)
     ->function(not bound to class and obj) vs method(define inside class and called using obj)
     ->magic method /dunder method
     ->self-obj which allow you to access all your attributes
     ->You can create attributes outside the class as well
     
     ->encapsulation
     ->getter and setter->(used to get and set the hidden attributes)
     ->static methods->(do not require ibj to access it ,no self in req)
     ->Inheritance
